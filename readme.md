# **Mocha project**

## _this is just a brief project created to write sample_
## _tests with Mocha and Chai as a nice little bonus!_

### this project includes
* Node js
* Mocha
* Chai

I always see tests written  in other frameworks mainly Jest. I have nothing against
Jest, but I just wanted to try something else out for size. Besides Mocha is a
very cool name in my book.


this project also uses Chai which is an assertion library that extends Js's built
in asserstion library.

should be short sweet and simple.
