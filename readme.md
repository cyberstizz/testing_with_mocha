# **Mocha project**

## _this is just a brief project created to write sample tests with Mocha and Chai as a nice little bonus!_

### this project includes
* Node js
* Mocha
* Chai


### Synopsis
I always see tests written  in other frameworks mainly Jest. I have nothing against
Jest, but I just wanted to try something else out for size. Besides Mocha is a
very cool name in my book.


this project also uses Chai which is an assertion library that extends Js's built
in asserstion library.

should be short sweet and simple.


### Code Review
in short, there is a file called app.js which contains two funcions. Both of these functions are wrapped inside of an object which is exported at the top.

The tests are written in a file inside of the test folder. The file is called test.js(I know innovative). Inside of the file there are three tests written within describe and it blocks which make up the foundation of Mocha. It basically works like this...

the describe block starts with the string returnString. returnString is the first function within our app.js file.After the first two tests there is a multiply function.


- this project has a total of 3 tests:
 * the first two tests are assertions which declare that the returnString function should return a string and be a string
 * the third test tests that the multiply function will acutally multiply inputs. So inside of the test I create two variables with random numbers and put those numbers into the multiply function.

### final thought
#### all three tests work, so I performed my happy dance. thanks for coming. happy coding!
